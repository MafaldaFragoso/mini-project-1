## Project Description
Chellenge: Cryptography with Python: communication between two users via coded messages
Method used: Caesar Cipher Cryptography 
 

## Rules
Each letter of plain text is replaced by a letter with some fixed number of positions down with alphabet to be encrypted or decrypted  

## Workflow
1. Research about the game
2. Design of the game structure (pseudocode)
3. Code game
    Creation of a function that asks if users wants to decrypt or encrypt
    Creation of a function that returns the message (clear text or encrypted)
    Creation of a function that applies decryption or encryption methods 
    Print resulting message
4. Error handling
5. Test game


## Organization
Project planning on the trello board
In my repository you will find the Python file with the coding and the presentation in power point. Within the presentation, you will find the trello baord picture
